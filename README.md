4. PLEASE NOTE THAT I WILL TRY MY BEST TO HOST MY BACKEND AND FRONTEND IN OTHER FREE SERVERS SUCH AS VERCEL AND RENDER INSTEAD OF LOCAL HOST.

## How to Run Backend
1. Open terminal for the backend folder.

## Challenges I faced
1. Getting the frontend to work, I had to troubleshoot and mess with a bunch of code to get the java script working.
2. The API key funding, I did not even know I had to fund the API key in order for the AI to actually work.
3. The agents for the backend, I had to spend quite a bit of time writing descriptions for the AI agents in order for them to understand what the student is asking, and what the subject matter is.
